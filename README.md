meteor-template
===============

My basic template for new Meteor projects.

Templates: mquandalle:jade, and head.tpl.jade, home.tpl.jade in client
Scripts: coffeescript
Styles: cryptoquick:stylus-multi and a main.styl in client
Routing: iron:router and some configuration

Others:
spiderable
browser-policy
fortawesome:fontawesome
momentjs:moment
meteorhacks:fast-render

Source Sans Pro (from Google Fonts, via <head> in main.jade)

Support in router config for reywood:iron-router-ga, but not added

To use
------

Clone, add/remove packages as needed, remove remote, add new remote, enjoy.

Branches
--------

There's at the moment an `ionic` branch, which serves as a template for using Ionic via Meteoric, and a `ionic+profiles`, which builds user profiles on top of that. Other such branches may be added in the future.

To use such a branch, simply check it out instead of master, and use that for your project.
